Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Cristian Medina or you can call me LoximtoMedina or only Loxi.

Iâ€™m currently working on my future, making little steps that makes me a better developer. Currently I'm learning responsive web design, graphic interfaces with python and database management. Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on a big project, but maybe we can collaborate when I'm get better in all areas I want to be better

You can reach me in Gmail by sending a mail to crjosuem911@gmail.com or you can send a DM to LoximtoMedina in instagram.

- âš¡ Fun fact:When I started in this world, what I saw in my future was a young adult making video games and, as I grew up and tried a spoonful of each branch, I realized that I wanted it all.
